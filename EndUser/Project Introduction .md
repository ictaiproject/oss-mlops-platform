# MLOps Infrastructure Project

## Introduction

The **MLOps Infrastructure Project** aims to streamline machine learning (ML) operations from experimentation to deployment by integrating modern DevOps practices into AI/ML workflows. This project focuses on building an open-source MLOps platform (**OSS MLOps**) to enhance the lifecycle management of AI models, including their development, versioning, deployment, and monitoring.

MLOps (**Machine Learning Operations**) is an essential framework that ensures scalability, reliability, and efficiency in ML systems, similar to how DevOps optimizes software development. This project allows students and professionals to gain real-world skills in setting up MLOps infrastructure while learning best practices in **Docker** and **Kubernetes**.

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to:

- Develop an **MLOps platform** that supports ML model training, versioning, and deployment.
- Enhance **AI trust and reproducibility** by maintaining automated logging, tracking, and performance monitoring of ML models.
- Provide **hands-on experience** with industry-standard tools such as **Docker, Kubernetes, and Jupyter Notebooks**.
- Enable **easy deployment of AI models as REST APIs** for real-world applications.
- Ensure **AI/ML workflow automation** for efficient model lifecycle management.

## Project Goals

### **1. Infrastructure Setup**
- Deploy a **Kubernetes-based MLOps platform** (using **Kind** or a cloud-based environment like **Cpouta**).
- Configure **MLflow** for model tracking and versioning.
- Set up **Jupyter Notebook** for ML experimentation.

### **2. Automation & Deployment**
- Implement **CI/CD pipelines** for automating ML model deployment.
- Enable **containerized execution** via **Docker and Kubernetes**.

### **3. Security & Optimization**
- Secure the MLOps infrastructure with **reverse proxies (Nginx), Istio service mesh, and authentication mechanisms**.
- Optimize AI workloads for **cloud, supercomputing (CSC IT Center of Science), and local environments**.
